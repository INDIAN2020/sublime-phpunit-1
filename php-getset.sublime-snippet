    php-getset
        A time-saving device for creating getters & setters in PHP classes

        Based on a snippet originall published by @akrabat:
        http://akrabat.com/software/sublime-text-2-snippet-for-php-getter-and-setter-generation/

    HOW TO USE
        In your PHP class, simply type the following:

            php-getset<TAB><name of your property without a $ sign>

        Sublime Text will add the getter and setter to your class, and
        name them after your property.

        For example, if your property is called $connection, you would
        go into your class, and type:

            php-getset<TAB>connection

        and Sublime Text will create getConnection() and setConnection()
        methods for you.
